# snake-n-ladders
A 2 player CLI rendition of the classic Snake n Ladders with a twist.

"snakeNladders.cpp" contains the main code which decides the flow of the game. "linkedListOperations.cpp" is a file I've created which includes linked list functions, some of which are required for the functioning of the game.

This is failry basic but I've always wanted to implement this in C++. Feedback/suggestions is always appreciated.
